/*** Css Transitions Triggered by JavaScript ***/

Using Css transitions with JavaScript is awesome. You can declare a 
transition in Css, then trigger it with a JavaScript event or just
plain JavaScript. Let's say I wanted to transition the width a div.
The transition property is the width, the duration is 0.6s, the 
timing function is ease-out & the delay is 1s.

In the JavaScript, I would change the width of the div & the transition
would play when the browser is reloaded.

/* Transitions on events */

You can trigger transitions on JavaScript events. You grab the last 
example and trigger the width property on click.

/* Triggering multiple transitions */

Let's say we have two transitions we want to trigger on click. The
width & the background color. We would declare both transitions in the
css code.

Then with JavaScript, specify what we want the properties new values 
to be on click.

/* Transitioning a property by clicking another element */

You don't have to click the element that the transition is on to trigger.
You can click a completely different element for any transition you
want to do. Let's say we have a button with the div we were using before.

When I click the button, the width & the background color of the div will
transition.

This can make for some really cool transitions. The best part is it's
suprisingly easy.
